# Frontend Mentor - Social links profile solution 🎯

This is my solution to the [Social links profile challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/social-links-profile-UG32l9m6dQ). It’s a static user card layout featuring styled profile details and interactive social links. I built this as part of my practice in refining responsive layouts and styling techniques using plain HTML and CSS.

## 🛠️ My Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox layout
- Mobile-first approach

---

### What I Learned

- Implementing `:hover` states with color transitions on button-like elements
- Fine-tuning layout spacing, especially between name and location with margin control
- Applying custom color palettes using HSL tokens for design consistency

---

### Challenges Faced

- The spacing between `h2` (name) and `h4` (location) was visually off; I learned to adjust margins precisely to align typography and preserve the design’s compactness.
- Button hover styles were tuned to match the interactive cue without overpowering the background.

---

### Continued Development

No additional features planned at the moment — keeping it true to the original design for this challenge.
